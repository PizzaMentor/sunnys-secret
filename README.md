### Visual Guidelines
1. Speech Bubble Placement:

   - Avoid covering important visual elements
   - Use curved tails for normal dialogue
   - Use jagged tails for exclamations
   - For "Abh bataunga nahi" repetition:
     - Vary bubble shapes slightly
     - Use different positions in each panel
     - Add small visual elements (stars, sparkles) to keep it interesting

2. Panel Flow:
   - Maintain consistent reading direction (left to right, top to bottom)
   - Use gutters (spaces between panels) of 0.25" (6mm)
   - Ensure clear visual hierarchy in each panel

3. Character Design:
   - Sunny: Maintain consistent proportions and expressions
   - Mummy: Show progression of tiredness through the search
   - Papa: Appears only in first panel, establish clear design
