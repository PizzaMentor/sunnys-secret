   - For "Abh bataunga nahi" repetition:
     - Vary bubble shapes slightly
     - Use different positions in each panel
     - Add small visual elements (stars, sparkles) to keep it interesting

2. Panel Flow:
   - Maintain consistent reading direction (left to right, top to bottom)
   - Use gutters (spaces between panels) of 0.25" (6mm)
   - Ensure clear visual hierarchy in each panel

3. Character Design:
   - Sunny: Maintain consistent proportions and expressions
   - Mummy: Show progression of tiredness through the search
   - Papa: Appears only in first panel, establish clear design

## Workflow

2. Develop character designs and expressions
3. Create background templates
4. Layout panels with proper dimensions
5. Add dialogue and captions
6. Finalize artwork
7. Export in high resolution (300 DPI minimum)
